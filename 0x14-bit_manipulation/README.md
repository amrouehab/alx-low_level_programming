# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project is focused on implementing various functions for bitwise manipulation in C. The tasks involve converting binary strings to unsigned integers, printing binary representations, and manipulating specific bits within integers.

## Requirements

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Betty style is enforced.
- No global variables are used.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only standard C library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`.

## How to Compile

To compile the code, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o bit_manipulation
